NAME

Authen::Passphrase - hashed passwords/passphrases as objects

DESCRIPTION

This is the base class for a system of objects that encapsulate
passphrases.  An object of this type is a passphrase recogniser: its
job is to recognise whether an offered passphrase is the right one.
For security, such passphrase recognisers usually do not themselves know
the passphrase they are looking for; they can merely recognise it when
they see it.  There are many schemes in use to achieve this effect,
and the intent of this class is to provide a consistent interface to
them all, hiding the details.

The CPAN package Authen-Passphrase contains implementations of several
specific passphrase schemes in addition to the base class.  See the
specific classes for notes on the security properties of each scheme.
In new systems, if there is a choice of which passphrase algorithm
to use, it is recommended to use Authen::Passphrase::SaltedDigest or
Authen::Passphrase::BlowfishCrypt.  Most other schemes are too weak for
new applications, and should be used only for backward compatibility.
